This is packnam, a tool that converts a raw NES nametable (that is, an
array of tile indexes) into a format that can be readily decoded by
6502 code (i.e. so the image can be displayed on the NES).

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

See doc/index.html for documentation, or do "man packnam" after
installation.
