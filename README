packnam converts a raw NES nametable (representing some
graphical image) into a format that's easily decoded by
6502 code (i.e. so it can be displayed by the NES).

The input nametable is typically one produced by the
packchr tool.

The output is a sequence of strings of the following format:
byte 0: high VRAM address
byte 1: low VRAM address
byte 2: bits 0-5 length of data string (repeat count if RLE)
        bit 6 is data RLE? (1 = yes)
        bit 7 VRAM address increment (0 = 1, 1 = 32)
byte 3-..: data. Only 1 byte if string is RLE

6502 code for decoding data of this format can be found
elsewhere, e.g. in the NeoToxin sources (ppuwrite.asm).
In your 6502 sources, you can then do something like:

  my_nametable_data:
  .incbin "mynametable.dat" ; mynametable.dat produced by packnam
  .db 0 ; data terminator

  ...

  lda #<my_nametable_data
  ldy #>my_nametable_data
  jsr write_ppu_data_at     ; call decoder function

packnam does not deal with CHR data, palette data or
attribute data; you are responsible for setting up those
things when displaying the image on the NES.
(A simple way of setting up the palette and attribute
table is by "tacking on" their data to packnam's output;
use the string format described above.)
